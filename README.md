# hello-world
This is my first reposatory

## Plans
I hope to put up some ideas for the new 
[USF Data-Science 100](https://github.com/jdwilson4/Intro-Data-Science-2017) course.    
First I need to learn something about *githup*.

## Testing the Markdown

Looks at $\displaystyle \int_0^{\infnty} e^{-x^2) \, dx$.   Looks like Mathjax is not available.  
See 
[Rendering LaTeX Math Equations in GitHub Markdown](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rendering-latex-math-equations-in-github-markdown/) 
for a possible workaround.
